# Heroku_Graph_ML

Deployed Using Heroku at https://dspyt.herokuapp.com/

We are accessing Uniswap V3 GraphQL at https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v3?selected=playground to obtain historical data for the chosen token. The Default token is Uniswap.

Next we model the time-series data to predict token price for the N number of timestamps. Default is 15 periods.

We have Used Arima(1,1,0) model since it has maths foundation and differences the data to make it stationary.

In particular properties of AR(1) are as following:

We are also using the app to create a larger app for the Uniswap bounty. The app output ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66903336/146433297-49d145bc-7aef-4c79-8349-1b2db0b2352a.png)
